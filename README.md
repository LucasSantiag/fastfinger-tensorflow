# FastFinger Tesseract
www.10fastfinger.com is an entertainment web site to figure out how fast you can type. For my development skills improve I started create this BOT to play instead of a humam and cheat their Anti-Cheat.

# Why
Since I became a intern my desire to learn Python and Machine Learning got bigger, so start this random project to take the first steps learning was my main idea. 

# Built With
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - Python and R Package Manager
* [Tesseract OCR](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) - The Optical Character Recognition.
* [OpenCV-Python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) -  Computer Vision Library

# Results
The simple typing script was pretty easy to do. With Â±5 lines this is the result:

In the other hand the Anti-Cheat part was harder, but as result 1 became *_TOP 1_*

# Conclusion
At first the repository name was **fastfinger-tensorflow** because I wanted use http://tensorflow.org/ to recognize text from the image Anti-Cheat, but is harder than I thought that would be. 
If you wanna help me please contact me =)

# To Future
Make this project not only a first step, but be deeper than my first idea
  - [ ] Replace **Tesseract OCR** with **TensorFlow**
  - [ ] Improve the Anti-Cheat Accuracy
